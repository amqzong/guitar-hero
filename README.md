# Guitar Hero

# Description
A Guitar Hero game was built on an Arduino, featuring three buttons and a digital display. A plastic guitar was laser-cut, along with a rectangular box for the display screen. See "GuitarHero.jpg" for an image of the setup.

Rectangular "notes" would appear in random order on the screen and users have to press the button on the guitar matching the color of the "note" before the note disappears. The user's accuracy is tracked and displayed.
