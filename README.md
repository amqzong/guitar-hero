# Guitar Hero

# Description
A Guitar Hero game was built on an Arduino, featuring three buttons and a digital display. Rectangular "notes" would appear
in random order on the screen and users have to press the button matching the color of the "note" before the note
disappears. The user's accuracy is tracked and displayed.
